# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

# Introduction

The ability to categorize opinions expressed in the text of tweets—and especially to determine whether the writer's attitude is positive, negative, or neutral—is highly valuable. In this guide, we will use the process known as sentiment analysis to categorize the opinions of people on Twitter towards a hypothetical topic called #hashtag.

There are different ordinal scales used to categorize tweets. A five-point ordinal scale includes five categories: Highly Negative, Slightly Negative, Neutral, Slightly Positive, and Highly Positive. A three-point ordinal scale includes Negative, Neutral, and Positive; and a two-point ordinal scale includes Negative and Positive. In this guide, we will use a three-point ordinal scale to categorize tweets with #hashtag.
